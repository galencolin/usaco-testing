how the hell do you use this?

go to this directory in a linux shell

put the test cases (both input and output) into the test-files folder (keep the 1.in 4.out format of the filenames)
run tester.py (the compilation command is fixed in the program itself)

the command is:
python tester.py [testNum] [fileName]
where testNum is the number of test cases and fileName is the USACO program name (example: snowcow)
